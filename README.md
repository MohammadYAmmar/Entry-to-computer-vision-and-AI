Here you can run and modify examples or do required things like face recognition and the use of libraries like OpenCV, in addition to link reads using HTTP Request 
From artificial intelligence (AI) projects, During training with the smart methods company

#### <div>In the first two tasks it was, using the opencv library
First I used and tried Face Detection and that was the result </div>

#### <div>In the second experiment, she was to identify vehicles on the street from an existing video </div>

#### <div> In the end it was reading the content of a URL using (HTTP Request) </div>

#### <div> The third experiment was more realistic than the previous one by receiving only the direction character for the robot </div>
